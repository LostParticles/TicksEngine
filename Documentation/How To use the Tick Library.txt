Tick in the library means amount of beats



Overview:
--------

The Tick Library contains a Tick Manager
the Tick Manager is able to produce Ticks in the specified Tempo i.e. BPM (Beats Per Minute)

The idea is to store Ticks in the tick manager 
then when starting the tick manager it call the ticks codes based on the BPM value

each Tick has a hold beats and duration beats

for example if you pushed two ticks the tick manager will play their starting and ending procs



About Timing:
---------------

each tick event  is played sequentially after the previous tick

the holdBeat  count   holds the event from starting until the hold beats are over

so when the holdBeat is equal 0  the event starts the previous event

this means that holdBeat is a delta time between current event and previous event starting time.
