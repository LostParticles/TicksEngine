[TicksEngine 1.2]
-  Changed the name into TicksEngine   and reserved the domain name of it TicksEngine.com  .. and I have no money .. I am broke :D
- Added HardwareTicksGenerator  


[TickEvents 1.1]

- Separated ITicksEventsManager into ITicksManager and ITicksGenerator.
- Made a base class TicksManager that implements ITicksManager
- Made WindowsTicksGenerator that inherit TicksManager and implement ITicksGenerator.
- Added Unit Test fot the TicksManager class and solved many errors with it
-  Added some illustrative images under the documentation folder

- Next version: is to implement HardwareTicksGenerator and test it along WindowsTicksGenerator.
   then after that i will remove the legacy code of AccurateTickEventsManager and TickEventsManager.

   also I want to add svg image capability to draw the events as it seen in documentation images.

   another thing is to add SlowGenerator for events that occur on daily basis or more.
